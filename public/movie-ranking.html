<h1>The Best Games According to Rhys Elliott</h1>
<h2>My top 3 video games of the 2020s.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Last of Us: Part II</h3>
<p>A beautiful narrative cocktail of environmental storytelling, complex character relationships, and the cycle of violence.</p>
<h3>Hades</h3>
<p>A vibrant art style, fluid gameplay, and a delf handling of narrative in a die-retry rogue-like game.</p>
<h3>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</h3>
<p>A faithful remake of a game that changed my life as a kid. Features the killer gameplay, soundtrack, and skate culture I fell in love with.</p>
