<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Games and words—those two of my favorite things! But I'm also learning to code</p>

<p>I currently bridge the gap between Newzoo's games market analysis and writing. Before that, I worked across market research, copywriting, PR, and content strategy. </p>

<p>I’ve been writing about games professionally for five years and love dissecting the latest gaming trends and analyzing what they mean for the market. Outside of that, I co-host a games podcast with three of my friends. </p>

<p>When it comes to copy and marketing, my go-to is copy that converts and conversational copy. But I also enjoy technical writing and analysis. </p>

<p>Like I said: games and words are my jam! I want to add another ingredient, though: coding! Let's go!</p>
